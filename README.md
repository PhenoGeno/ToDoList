# ToDoList
Simple To Do List using JavaScript. This is one of my first projects. Nothing special.

How to use - 
  After submiting your task into the input box, you will be asked how urgent it is on a scale of 1-3. 1 being the least urgent, 3 being the most. Your tasks will show up as green, yellow, or red accordingly. Click your task once to strike a line through it, and double click to get rid of it entirely (not my idea) and be rewarded with a little beep.
